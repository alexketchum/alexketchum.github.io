            <h3>Douglas Gardens Elementary PTO</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I made this website for my daughter's elementary school PTO (Parent Teacher Organization). The project started out as a place for parents to order year books for the 2024-2025 school year.</p>
            <p>The original project was a web app made using React for the front end and python on the backend, which I needed to allow users to purchase the year books using Venmo and then add their data to a google spreadsheet for the PTO to see.</p>
            <p>The project has since become a full fledged website that was made using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
